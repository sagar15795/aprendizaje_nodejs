# Aprendizaje NodeJS

This has done with the help of [this tutorial](https://www.nodebeginner.org/) & [this link](http://www.hylianux.com/downloads/nodebeginner.pdf)

## Use Case

Let's keep it simple, but realistic:

- The user should be able to use our application with a web browser
- The user should see a welcome page when requesting http://domain/start which displays a file upload form
By choosing an image file to upload and submitting the form, this image should then be uploaded to http://domain/upload, where it is displayed once the upload is finished
- Fair enough. Now, you could achieve this goal by googling and hacking together something. But that's not what we want to do here.

Furthermore, we don't want to write only the most basic code to achieve the goal, however elegant and correct this code might be. We will intentionally add more abstraction than necessary in order to get a feeling for building more complex Node.js applications.
